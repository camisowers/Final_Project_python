# Final_Project_python
Goal: Learn how to code in Python (3) and code a Blackjack game.


Since I have no prior knowledge about Python, I am choosing to learn it through on online tutorial.
	https://www.learnpython.org/
  
  Here is a documentation of everyting I have covered. 
  
	6/19 - Lessons: "Hello World", "Variables and Types", "Lists"
	6/20 - Lessons: "Basic Operators", "String Formatting", "Basic String Operators" 
	6/22 - Lessons: "Conditions", "Loops", "Functions", "Classes and Objects"
	6/23 - Lessons: "Dictionaries", "Modules and Packages"
	6/27 - Overloading Operators (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahX28le3cZg), 
		Random Library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#functions-for-integers), 
		Switch (https://www.pydanny.com/why-doesnt-python-have-switch-case.html)
	7/2 - Fixing Error (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12845389/shufler-takes-exactly-1-positional-argument-2-given)
		Class Initialization (https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html)
	7/5 - Reading Console Input (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5404068/how-to-read-keyboard-input)

		Inheritance (https://www.python-course.eu/python3_inheritance.php)
	7/11 - Smart Pointers (http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/smart_ptrs.html)
		Templates (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6725868/generics-templates-in-python)

I have coded a complete game of blackjack in Python(3). I ran into a few issues since this language's classes and object orientation vary slightly from C++. The code itself is much simpler in nature than what I was used to, so at times I wasn't sure how to make specific instructions for things Python inherently accounts for. Although I coudln't incorporate everything from class into my code, I afterwards researched the topics in python to make comparisons to what we learned for C++.

I have also included "python_notes.txt" which is a file of the notes I took while learning Python(3), that helped me to code my project.
